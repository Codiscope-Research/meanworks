PROBLEM

One of the best way to test AngularJS app is to use Selenium WebDriver Manager and WebDriverIO.
This adventure is about installing WebDriver. Your WebDriverIO is already installed (via npm install from package.json)!

1. Install webdriver-manager
2. Update it with webdriver-manager update
3. Start it with webdriver-manager start

WebDriver is a command-line tool so install it with npm accordingly.

The npm name is webdriver-manager.

Run `$ $ADVENTURE_COMMAND verify` when you are ready to check the installation and the version.

HINTS

We use -g flag (or --global) when installing command-line tools:

$ npm install -g webdriver-manager
$ webdriver-manager update
$ webdriver-manager start


---

Run `$ $ADVENTURE_COMMAND verify` once that is done.

Some helpful commands:

`$ $ADVENTURE_COMMAND help` to get help with the workshop
`$ $ADVENTURE_COMMAND print` to re-display the current exercise
`$ $ADVENTURE_COMMAND verify YOUR_FILE_NAME` to verify that you have finished an exercise
`$ $ADVENTURE_COMMAND solution` to show the solution for the current exercise

`$ $ADVENTURE_COMMAND verify skip` to skip it.
