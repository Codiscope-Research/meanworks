PROBLEM

Bower is like an npm only for front-end modules. It has a flat-structure in its dependency folder bower_components.

Please install bower like any other npm module. Do it globally, because bower is a command-line tool and not a project dependency. (Command-line tools installed globally while project dependencies installed locally.)

We are using v1.4.1. Please use bower v1.4.1.

Run `$ $ADVENTURE_COMMAND verify` when you are ready to check the installation and version of MongoDB.

---

HINTS

Use `bower --version` to check the version.

To install bower v1.4.1 execute this command in your Terminal/Command prompt:

$ npm install -g bower@1.4.1

If you're working under proxy, configur bower appropriately.
