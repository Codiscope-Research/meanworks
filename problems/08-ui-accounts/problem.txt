PROBLEM

This is the time to use your front-end skills and implement some UI for transactions.

1. Code the template with these elements:

* Form
* List of existing accounts

2. Supply the data from the server via the controller.
3. Implement the method to save the new account

BONUS

Implement the delete buttons (both HTML and controller calls to API).

HINTS

The database must be running in its own window/tab or in detached mode. To start the DB, run `$ mongod`.

The template can look like this http://bit.ly/1TB5g7B.

The controller uses this code: http://bit.ly/1TB59c8.
