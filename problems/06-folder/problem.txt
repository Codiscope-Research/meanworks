PROBLEM

We need to create a folder for our project, so everything can stay neat and well organized.

Create a folder with the name is `mean` in the meanworks folder, and navigate (cd) into it.
This is where you'll put all of your project files.
It's important to maintain your code in that folder because MEANWorks will look for your code in that folder.

Once inside mean, create a minimal package.json file.

Run `$ $ADVENTURE_COMMAND verify` when you are ready to check the installation and version of MongoDB.

BONUS points if you copy these script commands into your new package.json:

"scripts": {
  "test": "./node_modules/mocha/bin/mocha test.js",
  "start": "node ./node_modules/nodemon/bin/nodemon.js index.js",
  "seed": "mongoimport  --host=127.0.0.1 --port=27017 --db mean --collection transactions --file transactions.json --jsonArray",
  "seed-accounts": "mongoimport  --host=127.0.0.1 --port=27017 --db mean --collection accounts --file accounts.json --jsonArray"
},

We'll be using these commands later.

HINTS

Use `$ mkdir mean` to create folder and `$ cd mean` to navigate into it.

To generate package.json, use `$ npm init`

The example of the package.json file generated by npm where all questions were skipped:

{
  "name": "mean",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "",
  "main": "index.js",
  "scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
  },
  "author": "",
  "license": "ISC"
}

HELP

Run `$ $ADVENTURE_COMMAND verify` once that is done.

Some helpful commands:

`$ $ADVENTURE_COMMAND help` to get help with the workshop
`$ $ADVENTURE_COMMAND print` to re-display the current exercise
`$ $ADVENTURE_COMMAND verify YOUR_FILE_NAME` to verify that you have finished an exercise
`$ $ADVENTURE_COMMAND solution` to show the solution for the current exercise

`$ $ADVENTURE_COMMAND verify skip` to skip it.
