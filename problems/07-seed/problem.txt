PROBLEM

We'll need some seed data for our application.

Download the JSON files for transactions and accounts

https://github.kdc.capitalone.com/secollege/mean/raw/master/code/transactions.json
https://github.kdc.capitalone.com/secollege/mean/raw/master/code/accounts.json

Start the database (on localhost and default port) and execute the imports form JSON files with these commands:

$ mongoimport  --host=127.0.0.1 --port=27017 --db mean --collection transactions --file transactions.json --jsonArray
$ mongoimport  --host=127.0.0.1 --port=27017 --db mean --collection accounts --file accounts.json --jsonArray

--db mean: name of the database
--collection: name of the collections
--jsonArray: allows mongoimport to take an array instead of an object


You should be able to see your data in mongo console ($ mongo) with these commands:

> use mean
> db.accounts.find()
> db.transactions.find()

Run `$ $ADVENTURE_COMMAND verify` when you are ready to check the installation and version of MongoDB.

---

HINTS

The database must be running in its own window/tab or in detached mode.

To start the DB, run `$ mongod`.

Run `$ $ADVENTURE_COMMAND verify` once that is done.

Some helpful commands:

`$ $ADVENTURE_COMMAND help` to get help with the workshop
`$ $ADVENTURE_COMMAND print` to re-display the current exercise
`$ $ADVENTURE_COMMAND verify YOUR_FILE_NAME` to verify that you have finished an exercise
`$ $ADVENTURE_COMMAND solution` to show the solution for the current exercise

`$ $ADVENTURE_COMMAND verify skip` to skip it.
