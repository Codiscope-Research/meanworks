PROBLEM

This is the time to use your front-end skills and implement some UI for transactions.

1. Code the table with these fields:

* Date
* Description
* Category
* Amount
* Action

2. Supply the data from the server via the controller.

BONUS

Implement dispute and cancel dispute buttons (both HTML and controller calls to API).

HINTS

The database must be running in its own window/tab or in detached mode. To start the DB, run `$ mongod`.

The table code can look like this http://bit.ly/1TB1IC0.

The controller uses $http.get like this:

$http.get('/api/transactions').success(function(transactions) {
  $scope.transactions = transactions;
});
