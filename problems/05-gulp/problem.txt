PROBLEM

Gulp is a build tool for front-end apps. It uses streams and a more imperative style compare to Grunt's configurational style.


Please install gulp like any other npm module. Do it globally, because gulp is a command-line tool and not a project dependency.

We are using v3.9.0.

Run `$ $ADVENTURE_COMMAND verify` when you are ready to check the installation and version of MongoDB.

---

HINTS

Use `gulp --version` to check the version.

To install execute:

$ npm install -g gulp@3.9.0

If you're working under proxy, configur gulp appropriately.


---

Run `$ $ADVENTURE_COMMAND verify` once that is done.

Some helpful commands:

`$ $ADVENTURE_COMMAND help` to get help with the workshop
`$ $ADVENTURE_COMMAND print` to re-display the current exercise
`$ $ADVENTURE_COMMAND verify YOUR_FILE_NAME` to verify that you have finished an exercise
`$ $ADVENTURE_COMMAND solution` to show the solution for the current exercise

`$ $ADVENTURE_COMMAND verify skip` to skip it.
